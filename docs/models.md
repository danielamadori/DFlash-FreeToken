# Supported models

FreeToken loads HF safetensors checkpoints directly, plus native GGUF for the
architectures listed under [GGUF](#gguf) below. The checkpoints below are
known-good — the prebuilt kernels are tuned for them; other checkpoints of the
same architectures work too.

## GGUF

Native GGUF, meaning the block-quantized weights are kept packed and dequantized inside
the kernels rather than expanded to bf16 at load.

| GGUF `general.architecture` | Covers |
|---|---|
| `gemma4` | Gemma-4 |
| `qwen3moe` | Qwen3 MoE (e.g. Qwen3-235B-A22B, Qwen3-30B-A3B) |
| `qwen35moe` | Qwen3.5 / Qwen3.6 MoE (e.g. Qwen3.6-35B-A3B, Qwen3.5-122B-A10B) |
| `qwen35` | Qwen3.5 / Qwen3.6 dense (e.g. Qwen3.6-27B, Qwen3.5-9B) |

Split checkpoints load: point `--model` at any shard of a `-00001-of-000NN` set, or at the
directory holding them. Metadata, config and tokenizer are read from shard 1 (later shards
carry only `split.*` keys), and the tensor tables are aggregated across the set. A missing
shard raises with the index named rather than loading a partial model.

Quant types follow what the vendored kernels in `csrc/gguf/` implement:

- Standard and K-quants (Q4_0, Q4_1, Q5_0, Q5_1, Q8_0, Q2_K through Q6_K) use MMQ for
  prefill and MMVQ for decode.
- I-quants (IQ1_S, IQ1_M, IQ2_XXS, IQ2_XS, IQ2_S, IQ3_XXS, IQ3_S, IQ4_NL, IQ4_XS) have no
  MMQ kernel, so prefill dequantizes and runs a plain matmul; decode uses MMVQ.

Two constraints worth knowing before picking a file:

- A MoE checkpoint's routed-expert banks must use one ggml type across every layer. The GPU
  slot pool is a single allocation with a single row stride, so a bank that changes type
  between layers cannot be served and the load fails with the offending layers named.
  llama.cpp's `_M` and `_XXS` levels raise the precision of the first few layers'
  `ffn_down_exps` and hit this; `llama-quantize --pure` produces a checkpoint that loads.
  Dense models have no expert banks and are unaffected.
- GGUF paths are TP=1 only, and a NextN/MTP block in the checkpoint is dropped (served
  text-only, no speculative decoding).

## MoE backends

These families accept image input by default; pass `--text-model-only` to skip the vision encoder. The flags are described in the
[CLI reference](cli.md#image-input); each family reads them in its own units.

| Family | Image tokens | `--image-min-tokens` / `--image-max-tokens` | `--mm-processor-kwargs` example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Qwen3.6 (both variants, every listed weight format), Qwen3.8-Flash-Next, Qwen3-VL | one token per 32x32 pixels of the resized image, dynamic resolution | pixel areas in `size.shortest_edge` / `longest_edge`; checkpoint defaults 64 to 16384 tokens | `{"size": {"longest_edge": 1048576}}` |
| Gemma-4 26B-A4B, 31B (`gemma4`: ViT tower, streamed under `--mm-encoder-weights host`) | one of the soft-token budgets 70 / 140 / 280 / 560 / 1120, every image scaled to its budget as far as the aspect ratio allows | the maximum picks the largest budget within it, below 70 is refused at start-up; the minimum has no effect | `{"max_soft_tokens": 1120}` |
| Gemma-4 12B (`gemma4_unified`: linear patch embedder, resident under either placement) | same budgets, one 48x48 super-patch per soft token | same as the tower releases | same |
| GLM-5.3-Flash (`glm5_next`: ViT tower, streamed under `--mm-encoder-weights host`) | one token per 28x28 pixels of the resized image, dynamic resolution on a canvas zero-padded to a 28-multiple | token counts, passed through as the processor's `min_image_tokens` / `max_image_tokens`; checkpoint defaults 16 to 8000 tokens | `{"max_image_tokens": 2048}` |
| Muse-Glimmer-30B (windowed ViT tower, streamed under `--mm-encoder-weights host`) | one token per 28x28 pixels of the resized image, aspect ratio kept under a token cap; checkpoint default 4096 tokens | the maximum is the cap (`max_image_tokens`); the minimum has no effect | `{"max_image_tokens": 1024}` |
| MiniMax-M3 (`minimax_m3`: CLIP-style ViT tower, streamed under `--mm-encoder-weights host`) | one token per 28x28 pixels of the resized image, dynamic resolution | pixel areas in `size.shortest_edge` / `longest_edge`; checkpoint defaults 4 to 576 tokens | `{"size": {"longest_edge": 1048576}}` |

## MoE strategies

`ft serve --moe-strategy {auto,fused,offload,cpu,hybrid}` (`--moe-backend` is the deprecated old spelling):

- **fused** — experts resident on GPU (needs the VRAM); never auto-selected.
- **offload** — experts live in host RAM, an LRU cache of expert slots on GPU;
  misses stream over PCIe.
- **cpu** — misses are computed on the CPU instead of fetched.
- **hybrid** — per step, fetches some misses over PCIe and computes the rest on
  CPU, overlapped. Run `ft bench bw` once per machine to calibrate the split.
- **auto** — dense models always resolve to `fused`; MoE models resolve to
  `offload`, upgraded to `hybrid` when a cached `ft bench bw` profile
  recommends it.

## Notes

- `ft checkpoint` conversion is optional — it pre-converts a checkpoint into
  FreeToken's fast-load format, and `ft serve --model` auto-detects the result.
- FTW files converted by builds before the quantization refactor may fail to load;
  see [ftw-hotfix.md](ftw-hotfix.md) for the affected checkpoints and the repair tool.
- An FTW converted before its family served images holds no vision encoder: `ft serve`
  refuses it unless started with `--text-model-only` (or `--mm-disable vision`); reconvert it
  with `ft checkpoint`, or add the encoder in place with [scripts/ftw_hotfix.py](ftw-hotfix.md).
- DeepSeek-V4 checkpoints must keep the `inference/config.json` subdir — the
  authoritative model args are read from there.
- Qwen3.8-Flash-Next keeps a 47.7 GiB PLE n-gram table pinned in host RAM.
